## References 

- [ ] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator for my ternary operator 
- [ ] all of my work has come from collaboration with fellow teammates, attending TA hours, as well as referencing notes/code alongs
- [ ] I tried to make it as DRY as possible but didn't feel confident enough in my loops to make it completely "DRY" 


## TO - DO 

- [ ] My checkWin function isn't running through my array properly, so I need to reassess my loop or conditionalstatements 
- [ ] I also need help with having the computer print the results on the webpage vs the console
